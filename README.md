# glyphspack

`glyphspack` converts between the  `.glyphs` and `.glyphspackage` file format flavors of the [Glyphs font editor](https://glyphsapp.com).

## Usage

Convert between `.glyphs` and `.glyphspackage` files:

```sh
$ glyphspack SomeFont.glyphspackage
Unpacking SomeFont.glyphspackage into SomeFont.glyphs
$ glyphspack OtherFont.glyphs
Packing OtherFont.glyphs into OtherFont.glyphspackage
```

Write the contents to the standard output:

```sh
$ glyphspack -fo /dev/stdout SomeFont.glyphspackage
```

Options:

- Set the output file name with `-o`/`--out`.
- Overwrite any existing files with `-f`/`--force`.
- Suppress log messages with `-q`/`--quiet`.

Run with `--help` for a complete parameter description.

## Installation

`glyphspack` can be installed from source with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```
